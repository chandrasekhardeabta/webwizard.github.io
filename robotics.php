                                 <p class="mb-20 mt-20"> Robotics is the field of technology that involves creating and using robots. Robots are machines designed to do tasks, often ones that are repetitive or difficult for humans. They can be controlled by computers and can work in many areas like factories, hospitals, or even space. Some robots are simple, like those that help build cars, while others are advanced, like robots that can walk or even talk. The goal of robotics is to make life easier by automating tasks and helping people do things more efficiently. </p>

                                       <p>Rules and regulations in robotics are important to ensure that robots are used safely and responsibly. As robots become more advanced, it's important to make sure they don’t harm people or cause damage. These rules help control how robots are made, what tasks they can do, and how they interact with humans. Governments and organizations work together to create guidelines that protect people and ensure robots are used in ways that benefit society.</p>

                                    <p>We choose robotics because robots can help make our lives easier by doing tasks that are hard, repetitive, or even dangerous for humans. Robots can work faster, more accurately, and without getting tired, which makes them great for jobs like building things in factories, exploring space, or helping in surgeries. By using robots, we can save time, reduce mistakes, and improve safety. Robotics also opens up new possibilities for innovation and can help us solve complex problems in many areas, from healthcare to manufacturing. </p>
